# 🔍 Smart Cybersecurity Multi-Agent System
## *Real-time Threat Detection and Response for Organizations*

---

## **🎯 THE PROBLEM**
Organizations struggle with cybersecurity because:
- **Too many alerts** - security teams get overwhelmed 
- **Slow response times** - threats spread while humans investigate
- **Missing connections** - attacks across network and system logs go unnoticed
- **Manual work** - everything requires human analysis and response

## **💡 OUR SOLUTION: Intelligent Security Agents**

We're building a **multi-agent system** where different AI agents work together like a security team - one detects threats, another investigates them, and a third responds automatically.

### **🧠 SYSTEM DESIGN**
```
Network Logs ──┐
                ├──► DETECTION ──► ANALYSIS ──► RESPONSE
System Logs  ──┤     AGENT         AGENT       AGENT
Threat Intel ──┘
```

**Detection Agent**: Spots suspicious activity in logs using machine learning
**Analysis Agent**: Investigates threats and assigns risk scores  
**Response Agent**: Suggests or takes automatic actions to stop threats

## **🚀 OUR APPROACH**

### **Step 1: Smart Detection**
- Use the provided network and system logs to train ML models
- Apply **Random Forest** and **Isolation Forest** algorithms (proven and fast)
- Detect known threat patterns + unknown anomalies
- Cross-check against threat intelligence database

### **Step 2: Intelligent Analysis** 
- Combine network and system events that happen around the same time
- Calculate threat severity scores (High/Medium/Low)
- Identify attack patterns (DDoS, Malware, Phishing, Port Scans)
- Create detailed incident reports

### **Step 3: Automated Response**
- Block suspicious IP addresses automatically
- Alert security teams about high-risk threats
- Isolate compromised user accounts
- Generate action recommendations

## **⭐ KEY FEATURES**

### **🔍 Real-Time Threat Detection**
- Processes network traffic and system logs continuously
- Detects 4 main threat types: DDoS, Malware, Phishing, Port Scans
- Finds both known attacks and suspicious anomalies

### **🤖 Agent Coordination**  
- Agents share information and work together
- Automatic escalation of high-priority threats
- No human intervention needed for common threats

### **📊 Live Dashboard**
- Real-time threat monitoring and alerts
- Charts showing attack patterns over time  
- System health and performance metrics
- Detailed incident reports

### **Working System**
- Multi-agent cybersecurity platform that actually works
- Real-time processing of the provided log data
- Web dashboard showing live threats and responses

### **Performance Targets**
- **Detection Speed**: Process 1000+ log entries per minute
- **Accuracy**: 85%+ threat detection with low false positives  
- **Response Time**: Automatic actions within 10 seconds

### **Demo Deliverables**
1. **Live Demo**: Working system processing real log data
2. **Source Code**: Complete Python codebase with documentation  
3. **Dashboard**: Web interface showing threats and responses
4. **Presentation**: 10-minute demo of threat detection in action

## **🛠 TECHNOLOGY STACK**

**Backend**: Python with pandas, scikit-learn, Flask
**Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with charts  
**Data**: CSV files provided (network logs, system logs, threat intel)
**ML Models**: Random Forest, Isolation Forest (simple but effective)
